Practical Number : 07

Problem Specification : How to use arithmetic operators in java program

Implementation : 

class Exercise7{
	public static void main(String [] args)
	{
	int number1=10;
	int number2=20;
	
	System.out.println("The addition is "+(number1+number2));
	System.out.println("The substraction is "+(number1-number2));
	System.out.println("The multiplication is "+(number1*number2));
	System.out.println("The division is "+(number1/number2));
	System.out.println("The modulus is "+(number1%number2));
	}
}
	

Output : The addition is 30
         The substraction is -10
         The multiplication is 200
         The division is 0
         The modulus is 10

Conclusion : I have learnt about how to apply arithmetic operators in java.
